    "description": "This example shows how to plot data from multiple sensors on an Apple iOS device together in one timeline. Measurements of angular velocity and orientation will be collected from the device and plotted over absolute time. This will allow correlations between data from two sensors to be visualized based on the actual time of measurement.",
